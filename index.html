                   a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for the 
                   free intro course and found it incredibly fun!I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12 weeks was 
                   the best -and most grueling-time of my life.Since completing the course,I've successfully switched 
                   careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                <p class="mt-10">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                    I needed some structure from proffessionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was
                    encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                    The entire curriculum and stuff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait 
                    long for assistance.The agile team project,in particular,was outstanding.It took my learning to 
                    the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.In fact,I've often referred to it during 
                    interviews as an example of my development experience.It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommend!"
